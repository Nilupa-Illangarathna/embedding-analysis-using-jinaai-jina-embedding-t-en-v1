# Embedding Analysis using jinaai-jina-embedding-t-en-v1


## Overview

This repository contains code for processing and analyzing hotel review data by generating sentence embeddings. The generated embeddings can be used to analyze semantic similarities between positive review sentences, enabling deeper insights into customer sentiments.

## Models Used

- **SentenceTransformers Library**: We utilize the SentenceTransformers library, which provides pre-trained transformer-based models for generating high-quality sentence embeddings.
    - Model: `jinaai/jina-embedding-t-en-v1`
    - Description: A transformer-based model trained on English text data, capable of generating embeddings capturing semantic similarities between sentences.
